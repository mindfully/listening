1.	"Fight Test" (The Flaming Lips, Dave Fridmann, Cat Stevens)	4:14
  - reflecting on a conflict, reminders of uncertainty and surrender 
2.	"One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21"  	4:59
  - transition from surrender to love 
3.	"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1"  	4:45

5.	"In the Morning of the Magicians"  	6:18
  - consciousness remembers egos don't die from fighting them, but by ignoring them; the true counterintuitive death blows begin to land by surrendering to what is, as well as uncomfortably abandoning judgments with uncertainty over if it's the right action ("what is love and what is hate? And why does it matter? Is to love just a waste? And how can it matter?") 
6.	"Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell"  	4:34
  - reflecting on how the ego made me wait for the world to change while stubbornly trying not to change my selves 
7.	"Are You a Hypnotist??"  	4:44
  - the ego dies in the first half & is reborn in the second 
8.	"It's Summertime"  	4:20
  - consciousness introduces new ego to the world, the consciousness, & its dead old self, and itself? 
9.	"Do You Realize??" (The Flaming Lips, Dave Fridmann)	3:33
  - consciousness singing to new ego a eulogy mourning old ego 
10.	"All We Have Is Now"  	3:53
  - the logical new ego singing acceptance of old ego's death, recognizing & accepting its own inevitable demise in the future (how much of this acceptance it retains before its own end comes well determine how hard it will struggle before dying) 
11.	"Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia)"  
  - consciousness & ego enjoy the newfound peace
